Applying to Ada Developers Academy is a stressful, opaque process which I thought would be easier to navigate with the support of a community. After receiving my acceptance call from Ada, I created an online space to bridge the gap between prospective students and alumni, a supportive community guiding new applicants through the process. I also created a spreadsheet for applicants to fill with their timeline dates for each step (technical challenge, technical interview and final interview), in order to establish a database for future cohorts and help demystify the process. The group has been steadily growing with each cohort, and I noticed a lot of the same questions coming up again and again. I thought it would be useful to have an online collection of questions and answers for members to ask and reply to, with a potential additional feature allowing users to visualize the previous applicants' data from the spreadsheet.

My capstone project is a dynamic website allowing users to read, filter, post, upvote/downvote and answer questions. Visitors may read and filter questions by topic, while logged in users have access to all features via added options on the left side menu.

The plan was to deepen my Python, JavaScript and React knowledge while integrating some of the tech stack I would be using during my upcoming internship, namely GraphQL and Docker. After realizing my progression with GraphQL would not allow me to finish the project on time, I made a switch to Firebase. This change of direction taught me that critical decisions have to be made for the good of the project, and to remain open to change. I learned to pace myself, take short breaks when being stuck, and ask for help when my allotted time for troubleshooting was up; this helped access new ideas and keep the project on schedule. I learned that I am deeply dedicated to getting things done well, that bringing a project to term is extremely fulfilling, and that I am resilient and resourceful.

I enjoyed the intro to GraphQL, as well as the switch to Firebase, going from relational to non relational database and figuring out which is better for various situations. I also had fun creating the front end with Javascript and React, especially when integrating the dynamic module Flip Move to make my question and answer cards shuffle whenever a user clicks on a topic, or moves back to the main page. Aesthetically pleasing, it made a big difference in terms of user interaction and enjoyment! I ended up ahead of schedule and made the decision to launch my website to get user feedback before the deadline, which was not only invaluable - but also filled me with a great sense of accomplishment.

I was able to build a custom solution to a problem I noticed, and I modified it to enhance user experience after getting valuable feedback on a confusing component of my UI. I practiced asking tough questions and putting user experience first while being strict with my timeline. I gained experience with React, and Firebase was a good introduction to cloud computing. Using GraphQL allowed me to deepen my understanding of REST API's by comparing concepts and differentiating them. Similarly, using postgreSQL and then contrasting it to Firebase clarified the advantages and disadvantages of relational vs non relational databases.
